# Devices-Control-Library
Library contains main commands for work with devices.

## List Devices
- Power supply Agilent N5746A;
- Signal generator Rohde&Schwarz SMB100A 

## Description
The library provides a way to interact with the devices described above using a LAN-interface.
Interaction is provided through communication through **Socket**.


This library contains basic commands for working with devices.

Unfortunately, the implementation of most, but not all commands is implemented, since the implementation of all commands is not within the framework of the basic software operation conditions.

A complete list of commands is available in the relevant device documentation.

You can add this library yourself. Additions and changes are welcome :)

P.S. As the need of certain teams, the library can be updated.

## Attention
Before using the library in real projects, **please check its** for correct operation.

I would be very grateful for the errors and bugs found 🐞💬:pray:😊
