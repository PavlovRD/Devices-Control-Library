# Devices-Control-Library
Library contains main commands for work with power supply Agilent N5746A and signal generator Rohde&amp;Schwarz SMB100A 

This library contains almost all the basic commands for working with devices, wrapped in methods.
Unfortunately, many teams are missing, but this does not mean that they are not there - only those teams that were required for the main work under the specified conditions are used here. Teams can be added as necessary to use them by me or by you :)

Before "combat" use, please check the operability of all required functions together with the device.
